## Backstory
### Ward Bio -

Ward was a child during the Western Saharan unification. Mauritania and Morocco came to blows over the region when they realized no one was around to stop them. Morocco eventually claimed the area as well as parts of northern Mauritania as “compensation.” The Moroccan military is inherently political and Ward found himself on the wrong side of a coup two years ago, locked in a dark cell expecting to never see daylight again. Jenny-Jane got paid a lot of money to extract a Moroccan royal from the prison. Ward was in the right place at the right time. The Moroccan royal didn't make it but Ward’s quick thinking got Jenny-Jane out alive. She says they’re even, Ward disagrees. 
    
This happened a few months ago.

Currently staying at the No Tell Motel.
    
No car. Uses public transportation.


### Gary Bio - 

 -- currently unknown --

### Logan Bio -

100 years ago operator and cable drop would have meant something completely different. Somewhere above the ionosphere and low altitude satellites you'll find my lost soul. If you have ever jumped from the lower parts of the thermosphere you would know what I am talking about. Hurling the "vehicle my momma gave me" down back towards earth with fiber in hand to god knows where in whatever fucked up situation some shit bag group of grunts found themselves in. If you have ever woken up and wondered what city you were in you still have no clue what I am talking about. I was an operator who did over 900 cable drops in the various wars of my generation.I was proud of the work i did, I saved a lot of lives and data. Fuck those dust off assholes, operators and their fiber cables did more than any dick head flying metal targets.Think of the bandwidth of a single strand of fiber from the mesh net in the sky? Like an angel bringing a gift from god we gave mana to beings who knew nothing of the peaceful realm we dwelled in, yet were cast out to save their sorry asses.

    

### Red Mage Bio -

Respectable member of Chesterfield Heights; purchased a small warehouse where he has a shop setup with 2-1B where he does a majority of his projects. 2-1B was one of his first projects. He interned at the local hospital where he learned his trade of cyber-surgery. After a successful internship the council/elder/board approached him and said it was time that he paid back the community and he set off to the sprawl to make some money. After befriending Dominic Toretto was taught the profession of vehicle thief and started to make a living. After putting two and two together realized that a DNI would help increase the efficiency of boosting and did a quid pro quo with an exec at GeroNetics to get a DNI. Programmed 2-1B to do the surgery, after the semi success of the surgery he took on bigger jobs more frequently and this taxed his body. The jobs were always a success but eventually the toll taken on his body was great and his arm was severely injured. 2 -1B and himself replaced his arm , he decided to retire as a vehicle thief afterwards and took up residence with the hospital.  Looking to expand on his studies is very interested in becoming a full time cyber-dock. Through his success with the hospital a corporation took notice of him. Trynzinity approached him with a job to test out a drug on the living wall. He prefers to do jobs stealthy and with little to no violence. As working with the hospital has the first hand effects of reckless violence and the human body. His last job which brings us to the present was with Bill and he saved his life after he was shot up burning through his surplus of trauma derms. The area around Midori Aggregate unsettles him as the walls have eyes.
